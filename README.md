# Retail and Warehouse Sales Clustering

This repository contains an analysis of retail and warehouse sales data using K-means clustering. The project aims to segment sales data into distinct clusters and uncover valuable insights.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to apply K-means clustering to sales data and understand the patterns and trends within different sales clusters. We use Python and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib to conduct the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. K-means Clustering
4. Visualization
5. 
## Key Takeaways

- Three distinct sales clusters were identified: Low Sales, Moderate Sales, and High Sales.
- The clusters reveal clear patterns in sales distribution across months.
- The analysis provides insights for strategic decision-making in inventory management.

## GitHub Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/MichaelCerna/Retail-and-Warehouse-Sales-Clustering.git]`
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter`
3. Run the analysis notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis.ipynb`
